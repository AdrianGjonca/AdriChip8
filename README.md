# AdriCHIP-8
A simple CHIP-8 emulator made by Adrian Gjonca.
Written using C and SDL2.

## Notice
Currently there appears to be multiple major bugs. I suspect they are related to:
* A: the collision system, and 
* B: to the input system.

For this reason most games fail to work right now sadly. I plan to return to this project some time soon and fix these bugs but this project is currently on hold due to my wish to work on some other projects of mine.

## Compatiblilty
